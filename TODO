- handle image loading while scrolling upwards, which throws off position
  (prevent abrupt jumps caused by image loading when scrolling upwards)
- handle w as v (same lexicographic position)

  of 'k' and don't show the last entries for 'j'
- handle '|' in words when searching / be clever with compound words
