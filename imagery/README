Imagery of Svensk-Ungersk Ordbok by György Lakó (chief editor),
2nd ed., Budapest, 1972. Based on resources freely downloadable from
Project Runeberg: http://runeberg.org/svhu1972


INITIAL SETUP OF IMAGE RESOURCES

1. Download images from Project Runeberg
$ 01_download_images.sh             [<runeberg.org> -> tif]

2. Create single-column imagery with ScanTailor (de-skewed & cropped)
$ 02_run_scantailor.sh              [tif -> tif_out]

3. Create resources for Android application:
$ 03_mk_resources.sh                [tif_out -> drawable]

4. Create ImageSize.java
$ 04_mk_imagesize_java.sh           [drawable -> ImageSize.java]

After these steps successfully complete, the app is ready to be built
via gradle.


CORRECTION OF IMAGE RESOURCES

It might happen that an error is found in how the original images have
been processed.  In such cases, the ScanTailor project file must be
corrected. To do this, load the project in an interactive session via
running:

$ scantailor svhu1972.ScanTailor

and correct the problem found. Save the project and exit ScanTailor.
Proceed by running steps 2-4 above. Rebuild the app. If the imagery is
confirmed to be fixed in the app, pull-request the changes to
svhu1972.ScanTailor.
